# Unity MiniGame Collection

## 🎮 Game Overview
This project contains a collection of multiplayer mini-games built in Unity. Currently featuring two distinct game modes:
1. **Survival Arena:** Avoid hazardous sectors in a circular arena.
2. **Spin Wheel Survival (Mario Party Style):** Survive on a spinning platform where sections disappear!

# 1. Survival Arena MiniGame

## 🕹️ How to Play
- **Objective:** Survive all 5 rounds without getting eliminated.
- **Controls:** Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move.
- **Rules:**
  1. The game starts with a countdown.
  2. Each round, **2 random sectors** are marked as **Hazards** (Flashing Red).
  3. You have **5 seconds** to move out of the hazard zones.
  4. If you are on a hazard sector when the timer hits 0, you are **Eliminated**.
  5. The game ends after 5 rounds or if you are eliminated.

## 📅 Features
### ✅ Core Gameplay
- **Game Loop:** A structured loop managing Pre-Game, Rounds, and End-Game states.
- **Round System:** Currently set to **5 Rounds** per game.
- **Hazard Logic:** Randomly selects 2 sectors each round to become hazardous.
- **Player Elimination:** Accurately detects if a player is standing on a hazard sector.

### ✅ Visuals & Feedback
- **Sector Coloring:** Dark Blue-Gray (Normal) vs. Pulsing Red (Hazard).
- **UI HUD:** Countdown, Round Counter, and Hazard Timer.

# 2. Spin Wheel Survival (Mario Party Style)

## 🎮 Game Description
Inspired by classic party games, players stand on a rotating platform. The wheel spins at varying speeds and stops at a specific angle. Then, random sections of the floor disappear! Players must find safe ground to avoid falling into the void.

## 🕹️ How to Play
- **Objective:** Be the last player standing!
- **Controls:** **WASD** or **Click** to move (depending on configuration).
- **Rules:**
  1. **Phase 1: Spin!** The platform rotates rapidly. Players can move to position themselves.
  2. **Phase 2: Freeze!** Implementation dependent - players might be frozen in place.
  3. **Phase 3: Disappear!** 1-4 random sections of the floor vanish.
  4. **Phase 4: Survival!** Anyone standing on a missing section falls and is eliminated.
  5. **Phase 5: Reset!** The floor returns, and the next round begins.

## 📅 Development History & Features (New!)

### ✅ Core Mechanics (Implemented)
- **Advanced Spin System (`SpinWheelPlatformRotator.cs`):**
  - Uses Animation Curves for smooth acceleration and deceleration.
  - Stops precisely at 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360°.
  - Variable spin duration and speed.
- **Disappearing Floors (`PlatformSectionManager.cs`):**
  - Sections fade out (materials turn transparent) and colliders are disabled.
  - Warning phase handles flashing colors before disappearance.
- **Game Manager (`MarioPartyGameManager.cs`):**
  - Manages the entire flow: Spin -> Wait -> Disappear -> Check -> Reset.
  - Handles player states (Freeze/Unfreeze) during critical phases.
- **Player Physics (`PlayerController1.cs`):**
  - Custom gravity/falling mechanics.
  - "Freeze" ability (Kinematic Rigidbody) to prevent physics glitches during platform rotation.

### 🎨 Visuals & Audio
- **Dynamic Materials:** Floors fade out smoothly using transparency.
- **Sound Effects:** Audio hooks for Spinning, Stopping, Warning, and Falling.
- **Debug Gizmos:** Visual aids in Scene view for debugging rotation and safe zones.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 📁 Common / Shared
- `Assets/Scripts/MiniGame/`
  - `MiniGameManager.cs`: Logic for Survival Arena.
  - `MarioPartyGameManager.cs`: Logic for Spin Wheel Survival.
  - `PlayerController.cs`: Simple movement for Arena.
  - `PlayerController1.cs`: Advanced movement/physics for Spin Wheel.

### 📁 Spin Wheel Scripts
- `SpinWheelPlatformRotator.cs`: Handles the math and smoothing of the wheel's rotation.
- `PlatformSectionManager.cs`: Manages the visual fading and physical disabling of floor sections.

### 📁 Arena Scripts
- `ArenaController.cs`: Manages the collection of sectors.
- `SectorController.cs`: Helper script on each sector piece.

---

## 🔧 Setup & configuration

### Spin Wheel Settings
Adjust these on the `MarioPartyGameManager` GameObject:
- **Sections To Disappear:** How many slices of the pizza fall out (1-4).
- **Spin Duration:** How long the wheel spins.
- **Speed Curve:** Edit the curve in Inspector to change spin feel (Linear vs. Ease-Out).

## 📝 Recent Updates (2026-02-13)
- **New Game Mode Added:** Spin Wheel Survival (Mario Party style).
- **Code Refactoring:**
  - Separated `SpinWheelPlatformRotator` for cleaner logic.
  - Improved `PlayerController` with Freeze/Unfreeze mechanics to prevent physics bugs during rapid rotation.
  - Added `PlatformSectionManager` to handle complex material fading and collider toggling.
